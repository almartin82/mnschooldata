fetch_enr(end_year, tidy = TRUE, use_cache = TRUE)
}
\arguments{

2023-24 school year is year '2024'. Valid values are 2007-2024.}

\item{tidy}{If TRUE (default), returns data in long (tidy) format with subgroup
column. If FALSE, returns wide format.}

\item{use_cache}{If TRUE (default), uses locally cached data when available.
Set to FALSE to force re-download from MDE.}
}
\value{
Data frame with enrollment data. Wide format includes columns for
district_id, campus_id, names, and enrollment counts by demographic/grade.
Tidy format pivots these counts into subgroup and grade_level columns.

# Get 2024 enrollment data (2023-24 school year)
enr_2024 <- fetch_enr(2024)

# Get wide format
enr_wide <- fetch_enr(2024, tidy = FALSE)

# Force fresh download (ignore cache)
enr_fresh <- fetch_enr(2024, use_cache = FALSE)

# Filter to specific district (Minneapolis)
mpls <- enr_2024 |>
  dplyr::filter(grepl("Minneapolis", district_name, ignore.case = TRUE))
