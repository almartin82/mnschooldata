\title{Fetch Minnesota school directory data}
\usage{
fetch_directory(end_year = NULL, tidy = TRUE, use_cache = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{end_year}{A school year end used as the cache key. Defaults to the
current school year (July-June). For example, in March 2026 the current
school year is 2025-26, so end_year defaults to 2026.}

\item{tidy}{If TRUE (default), returns combined school+district data with
superintendent info merged into school records. If FALSE, returns a list
with separate \code{$schools} and \code{$districts} data frames.}

\item{use_cache}{If TRUE (default), uses locally cached data when available.
Set to FALSE to force re-download from MDE-ORG.}
}
\value{
If tidy=TRUE, a data frame with school-level directory data enriched
with district/superintendent info. If tidy=FALSE, a list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{schools}: School directory data with principal contacts
\item \code{districts}: District directory data with superintendent contacts
}
}
\description{
Downloads and processes school and district directory data from the MDE
Organization Reference Glossary (MDE-ORG). Returns a combined dataset
with school information, including principal and superintendent contacts.
}
\details{
MDE-ORG is a live directory -- the extract always returns the current
snapshot. There is no historical year parameter. The \code{end_year}
parameter is used only for cache key labeling.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get current directory (combined schools + districts)
dir <- fetch_directory()

# Get separate school and district data frames
dir_raw <- fetch_directory(tidy = FALSE)
dir_raw$schools
dir_raw$districts

# Force fresh download (bypass cache)
dir_fresh <- fetch_directory(use_cache = FALSE)

# Find schools in Minneapolis
mpls <- dir |>
  dplyr::filter(grepl("Minneapolis", district_name, ignore.case = TRUE))
}
}
